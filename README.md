What is This?
=============
Duke student entrepreneurs have gathered to create Brackets 4 Life, a webapp that allows people to create brackets for March Madness and the pot will go to charity to fight against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

The two videos explains more about our story and our mission.

Brackets will open up on March 17th, when the actual teams come out.
