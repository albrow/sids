What is This?
=============
Duke [student entrepreneurs](http://incube.us) have gathered to create Brackets4Life, a webapp that allows people to 
create brackets for March Madness. The proceeds will go to charity to fight against Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome. The bulk of the website was created in just one week.

The two videos explains more about our story and our mission. You can also checkout our facebook &
twitter pages to stay up to date.

Brackets will open up on March 17th, when the actual teams come out.
